# Proximity-Pulse
Proximity Pulse is a distance-sensing project using an ultrasonic sensor and LED indicators to provide visual feedback based on how close an obstacle is. The project illuminates different LEDs depending on the detected distance, offering a dynamic response for object proximity.

## Features
- Ultrasonic detection
- Visual feedback
- Quick responsivity

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- HR-S04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LEDs (3)
- 220Î© resistors (current limiting)
- Breadbord, Jumper Wires
