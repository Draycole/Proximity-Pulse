# Proximity-Pulse
Proximity Pulse is a distance-sensing project using an ultrasonic sensor and LED indicators to provide visual feedback based on how close an obstacle is. The project illuminates different LEDs depending on the detected distance, offering a dynamic response for object proximity.

## Features
- Ultrasonic detection
- Visual feedback
- Quick responsivity

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- HR-S04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LEDs (3)
- 220Î© resistors (current limiting)
- Breadbord, Jumper Wires

## How It Works
- The ultrasonic sensor begins to check the surrounding area for the nearest obstacle
- If it is greater than 20cm away, the yellow LED comes on
- If it is between 10 and 20 cm the blue LED comes on
- If it is between 5 and 10cm the red LED comes on
- If it less than 5 cm from the setup the red LED starts blinking/flashing

## Circuit Schematic
